# Portage patches
A few of my portage patches, which make your system lie about the presence of libraries

## Warning
The usage of these patches, will make any kind of bug fixing and/or maintaining work a pain.  
Your system will end up in a state where it is unable to tell if a dependency has been loaded or not, this makes it hard to analyze the binary through debuggers.
